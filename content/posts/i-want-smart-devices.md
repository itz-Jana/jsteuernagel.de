## Premise

As anyone that knows anything about me should be able to guess: I love technology.

I want devices in my life that are able to improve it.
Devices that help me do the things that I love doing.
Devices that are smart and can do what I need without explicitly having to tell them.

As a kid, I used to watch the show "Knight Rider", where Michael Knight has an intelligent car as his companion.

I loved the concept.
I loved how KITT could talk and connect more data in a split second than any human ever could.
And I wished to see the point where technology would become exactly that.

For so many years, I would get excited about any new developments.

As computers shrunk into smartphones and those became so incredibly powerful.

As computers moved onto the wrist and I was excited to have my first smartwatch with the original Pebble.
It felt so magical to be able to control certain functions of my phone, without even having to look at it.
I loved building automations with Tasker, which would figure out my context and map exactly the right functionality to my watch, when I needed it.

I was so excited for anything and everything.

I hoped these developments would continue and we could get closer and closer to devices that are true personal assistants.

## And then came *AI*

ChatGPT crashed into the public light with full force and I was excited!

I played around with it and at first I thought that this could be it: A monumental step forwards towards the dream that I had as a kid.
To have a computer connect insane amounts of data and give it to me, exactly as I need it, when I need it.

I tried to have it give me information, re-phrase text and generate code.
It seemed to good to be true.

And it was...

After a few days, when I tried to actually use it for something useful, I realized that all it was generating was garbage.
An output that is just good enough to fool a human into thinking it's actually good.
The code it generated doesn't work, the re-phrased text is incredibly verbose and information is just plain wrong.

I stopped using LLMs and checked in with development again, later.

- Bigger models
- Reasoning models
- Agents
- Everyone going absolutely nuts

But really: Nothing changed

I realized that the task that LLMs are trained to fulfill, is to generate text that *seems* right.
There is no concept of right or wrong in there.
Everything is made up.
If the statistical model, that is an LLM, generates an output that is factually correct, that's a coincidence.
It can and will just make shit up out of thin air and there is nothing one can do about it, because the technology in use is unfit to fulfill that need.

**As long as some *AI* can't admit that it doesn't know a thing, it's useless.**

## Grief

I felt betrayed.
I was hoping to get closer to the dream that I had as a kid.
But in reality I was being sold a **glorified statistical model that would regularly lie to my face**.
There isn't enough techno-optimism *in the world*, for me to be able to justify that.

I thought other people would surely realize the same thing soon and the tech would become irrelevant in no time.

I was wrong and here we are, where I feel like the whole world has gone insane.

## Principles

It has come to the point, where I can't simply ignore these technologies and pretend they don't exist.
I am being dragged into conversations about LLMs regularly, even at work.

So I've done, what I always like to do.
I've established my own principles and boundaries.

- I won't work on or provide support for any project that is directly related to *AI*
- If you don't take the time to write a message yourself, but instead have an LLM generate it, I don't need to spend the time reading it
- I will avoid companies and products that joined the AI bandwagon, as best as I can
    - This doesn't work fully, so if there is no other good option, I am willing to compromise for a something where I can at least easily avoid/disable anything AI related
- I will re-evaluate, if someone comes up with something better than an LLM (because LLMs can't be fixed)

## Conclusion

I really want devices that are smart.

I really want technology to be able to do cool things.

But every trend in the last couple of years has been promising that and only been delivering more and more garbage.

I am tired of it.
