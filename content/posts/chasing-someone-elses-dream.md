I just realized that I’ve been chasing after someone else’s dream.

I’ve been trying to force something onto myself that I thought aligns with the person that I want to be.
And every time it didn’t work out, I searched for a plausible explanation of what is missing, what else I need to try such that eventually it will work out.

If could have been entirely possible that the thing I was aspiring to, is something that I like the theory, yet is not actually for me.

But I never consider that.

Even though I would regularly get tired of trying and return to an old friend.
And every time I would feel so at home.
I would feel at ease and I felt like I could just be.

It took me way too dang long to see that.

But that leaves me with a question: What do I do now?
Realizing that the thing I tried so hard to integrate into my identity doesn’t actually fit feels like a failure.
Like I just couldn’t do it.

But in any case, I need to start defining myself based on who I am, not who I want to be.
I need to embrace the dissonance between what I think is theoretically right and what I end up doing.
I need to come to terms with not being that perfect version of myself, in order to remove unnecessary friction in my life and be able to focus on what I actually enjoy.
